# gottagoburger

## Overview

GottaGo-Burger is a restaurant app that utilizes a MySQL database in conjunction with Handlebars server-side html rendering to let users submit and display the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
 

## Technologies
Node.js
MySQl
npm packages mysql, express, express-handlebars, body-parser
Heroku to host

## How it Works

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the viewer -- waiting to be devoured. When the user clicks the 'Devour it!' button, the burger moves to the All Gone section on the right side. GottaGo-Burger utilizes a MySQL database to store all of the burgers, devoured or not.
